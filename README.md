Rule Engine Application
Overview
This application is a Flask-based rule engine that allows users to create, combine, and evaluate rules based on user-provided data. Rules are parsed into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for efficient processing. The application also includes a simple HTML user interface for interacting with the API.

Features
Create complex logical rules with operators like AND, OR, and NOT.
Evaluate rules dynamically based on user-provided data.
Combine multiple rules for advanced rule management.
Store and retrieve rules in a lightweight SQLite database.
Simple HTML/JavaScript UI for rule management.
Dependencies
The application relies on the following dependencies:

Python 3.8+
Flask: Web framework for serving API and UI.
SQLite3: Lightweight database for storing rules and metadata.
Docker: For containerization (Optional).
Jinja2: Template engine for rendering HTML.
Python Libraries
The Python libraries required are listed in requirements.txt. To install them, run:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Contents of requirements.txt:


flask
sqlite3
Design Choices
Abstract Syntax Tree (AST): The rule engine uses an AST to represent rules. Each rule is parsed and broken down into operands (conditions) and operators (AND, OR, NOT), which allows for efficient rule evaluation and the ability to dynamically modify rules.

SQLite Database: We use SQLite for storing rules and metadata because it’s lightweight and requires minimal setup, making it ideal for small applications and local development.

Flask for API and UI: Flask was chosen for its simplicity and ease of use. It provides a RESTful API for rule management and serves the HTML UI to interact with the system.

HTML/JavaScript UI: A simple UI is provided using HTML and JavaScript to allow users to interact with the API for creating and evaluating rules.

Build Instructions
1. Local Development (Without Docker)
Prerequisites
Python 3.8+
pip (Python package manager)
Steps
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-repository/rule-engine.git
cd rule-engine
Set up a virtual environment (recommended):

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install dependencies:


pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up the SQLite database: Run the following command to initialize the database:

python database_setup.py
This will create the rule_engine.db file and initialize the necessary tables.

Run the Flask application:


python app.py
The app will be running on http://localhost:5000.

Access the UI: Open your browser and go to http://localhost:5000. You should see the HTML interface where you can create and evaluate rules.

2. Running the Application with Docker
We’ve provided a Docker setup to containerize the application. This allows you to run the app in isolated environments with ease.

Prerequisites
Docker or Podman installed on your system.
Steps
Clone the repository:


git clone https://github.com/your-repository/rule-engine.git
cd rule-engine
Build the Docker container:

docker build -t rule-engine-app .
Run the container:

docker run -p 5000:5000 rule-engine-app
Access the application: The app will be running on http://localhost:5000. You can interact with the API and the UI as described above.

Dockerfile
Here’s the basic Dockerfile used to containerize the application:

# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.8-slim

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
COPY . /app

# Install the required Python packages
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Expose the port Flask will run on
EXPOSE 5000

# Run the application
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
3. Running Tests
We recommend writing unit tests for critical functions like rule parsing, evaluation, and database interactions. If you have tests, you can run them using:

python -m unittest discover -s tests
API Endpoints
Here are the core API endpoints provided by the rule engine application:

Create a Rule:
POST /create_rule
Request Body:

{
  "rule_string": "age > 30 AND salary > 50000"
}
Evaluate a Rule:
POST /evaluate_rule
Request Body:

{
  "rule_id": 1,
  "data": {"age": 35, "salary": 60000}
}
Combine Rules:
POST /combine_rules
Request Body:

{
  "rule_ids": [1, 2]
}
UI:
Access the UI via the root route GET / on http://localhost:5000.

Bonus Features
Real-time weather data integration: As an extension, you could integrate weather data APIs for real-time data processing.
Extended operators: Support for more complex operators like >=, <=, and !=.
Rule modifications: Provide endpoints to allow modification of existing rules.
Advanced UI: Implement a more sophisticated UI for managing rules, visualizing data, and evaluating rules.
Conclusion
This rule engine application is a flexible and powerful system for managing and evaluating complex rules. It provides a simple UI for interacting with the API and supports containerization with Docker for ease of deployment. Future improvements could include real-time data processing and more advanced rule manipulation features.
